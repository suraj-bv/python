1. Write a function to merge two sorted lists into one sorted list without using any built-in sorting functions
2. Given a string, write a function to find the first non-repeating character. If none exist, return None.
3. Implement a function to flatten a nested list. For example, [[1,2,[3]],4] should return [1,2,3,4].
